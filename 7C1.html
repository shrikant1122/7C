            <dt>High-level language</dt>
            <dd>A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. 
                In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate 
                (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing 
                a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language.</dd>
            <dt>Open-source</dt>
            <dd>Open-source software is a type of computer software in which source code is released 
                under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, 
                change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software 
                may be developed in a collaborative public manner.</dd>
            <dt>GUI</dt>
            <dd>A graphical user interface (GUI) allows a user to interact with a computer program using a 
                pointing device that manipulates small pictures on a computer screen. </dd>
            <dt>Object-oriented Language</dt>
            <dd>Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", 
                which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of 
                procedures. A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often 
                modify the data fields of itself. </dd>
